## Overview

The conventional [Hangman](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>) is a guessing game whereby one or more players guess a word or phrase by suggesting letters within a fixed number of guesses. Degen Hangman is my first project while attending the Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly, Singapore.

I modified the game to only include words or phrases from the "crypto" world and accordingly named it "Degen Hangman". As such, this game can also serve as an introduction for people that are interested in learning more about Web3-specific terms.

## Deployment

The game is deployed on Github pages: https://mazyuan85.github.io/Hangman

## How To Play

At the beginning of the game, every letter in the word or phrase will appear as an underscore. The player will then click on an letter from A to Z and if the letters appears in the word or phrase, the corresponding underscore will reveal the letter accordingly. The player will have a total of 8 turns to guess the correct answer, otherwise they lose.

## Key Learnings

## Future Improvements

- Timed-mode - allow the player the choice to play the game under a timed setting
- Game logging - do an analysis of the win/lose rate of each particular word
- Implement a game difficulty mode by grouping the data from the game logs
